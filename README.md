EcoBooks is a full-stack, cross platform mobile application which allows users to trade and buy books by exercising. By using the phones inbuilt accelerometer as a pedometer, the application tracks the number of steps made and converts them into 'BookCoins', which can be used to buy and trade books with other users. Trading can be organised through our hand-build messenger to negotiate prices and organise collection.

## Setup

- To test the application, you must first download expo go onto your smartphone.
- Then, fork and clone this repository onto your computer.
- Open the repository and run `npm install`
- Once the downloading has completed, run `expo start`
- A QR code will pop up in the terminal, if you have an iOS device, scan this with your camera, if you have an android device scan it through the expo go app.
